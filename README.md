# DataAnalysisForSecurity-Classificator
An incremental Data Analysis Project made for Cyber Security Master Degree
This data mining project, developed for the "Data Analysis for Security" course of study, aims to build a software classifier
that classifies software as malware or goodware. 
The project does not have a clear modularization but rather allows incrementally to build an efficient classifier
